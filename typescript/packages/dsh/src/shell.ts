   * narrowed to `read`, so mirage's own dispatch is what refuses the
   * write rather than a second permission layer bolted on here.
   *
   * The twin narrows, never widens, and that takes every part of the
   * source's view, which is what `narrow` in core stamps: modes, hidden
   * paths, hidden variables, command rules. Its modes cover every mount
   * at `read` (the one exception is the null sink, per
   * {@link SINK_PREFIX}), which is at least as narrow as whatever the
   * source held, since `read` is the weakest mode there is; naming a
   * mount only narrows it, so a prefix the map omits would keep its own
   * mode rather than disappear. The other three are copied from the
   * source session rather than recompiled, because the profile it was
   * created under is not something a session records.
   *
   * Leaving any of them behind widens. Hides are the obvious one: a
   * binding confined to `/allowed` would read `/secret` in read-only
   * mode although the same command is refused outside it. Command rules
   * are the one modes cannot stand in for, because a mode bounds a
   * mount and an account CLI reaches a service: a profile that denies
   * `slack message send` or `git push` still denies it here, where
   * every mount being `read` says nothing at all about it.
   *
   * The policy's `workspaceRoot` is deliberately not consulted anywhere:
   * it is a directory on the harness's machine, so containment against
   * it says nothing about this world. The mounts are the boundary.
   *
   * @returns the id of the read-only session.
