export const SEAWEEDFS_BROWSER_PROMPT = `{prefix}
  Remote SeaweedFS bucket (S3-compatible gateway) accessed via presigned URLs (browser runtime).
  Supports the full filesystem command set: ls/tree/cat/grep/find/du/cp/mv/rm/etc.
  Listing operations require the presigner to sign LIST/COPY operations in
  addition to GET/PUT/HEAD/DELETE — see S3BrowserPresignedUrlProvider docs.`
