    None when the command declares that option itself, when the parser
    does not read any word as one, or when an option the scan reads
    first is one the parser refuses.

    This is the one door both standard options come through, and it runs
    ahead of routing because neither answer belongs to a backend: `rm
    --version /ro/x` would otherwise meet the read-only refusal, and
    `mv --help /ram/a /disk/b` would otherwise reach the cross-mount
    relay, which bypasses the registered wrapper and MOVED THE FILE. The
    two are one mechanism rather than two because GNU answers both from
    the same long_options table, so they are ordered against each other
    by scan position like any other pair of options: measured on
    coreutils 9.7, `cat --help --version` is the help page and
    `cat --version --help` is the version line.

    Three rules about position, all of them GNU's and none of them
    restated here:

    Which words the scan has read when it answers, because a standard
    option is an option like any other and an error the scan meets first
    is what GNU reports: `cat --bogus --vers` is `unrecognized option
    '--bogus'` (exit 1) and `grep --bogus --vers` is grep's own (exit
    2), where `cat --version --bogus` prints the version and exits 0.
    So the words ahead of the option are re-read through the parser and
    a refusal among them declines the answer. Two families answer
    elsewhere and carry their own tables: STANDARD_AFTER_SCAN finishes
    the whole line first, STANDARD_BEFORE_SCAN answers ahead of every
    option. Both are gated on the spec being the builtin's own grammar,
    since a mount may register a command under one of those names.

    Whether that word is the option at all, which only the parser can
    say: a declared remainder slot is argparse's REMAINDER, so the first
    operand ends option parsing and every later word belongs to the
    program being run; `--` ends it too; and a value-taking option
    swallows the word after it. Asking the parser covers all three.

    And gnulib's ``parse_long_options``, which reads argv[1] only when
    it is the whole line (``argc == 2``), so for a
    SOLE_ARGUMENT_LONG_OPTIONS command the option is an ordinary operand
    as soon as another word joins it (`expr --version` is the version,
    `expr --version x` is `expr: syntax error: unexpected argument
    'x'`). The parser already applies that window, so this reads its
    answer rather than carrying a second copy of the rule.

    Args:
        name (str): command name as invoked.
