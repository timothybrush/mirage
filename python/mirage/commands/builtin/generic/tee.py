    An operand that cannot be written is diagnosed and skipped rather
    than ending the run: GNU keeps going and still writes the rest, and
    only ``--output-error=exit`` stops at the first failure. stdin always
    reaches stdout either way.

    "Cannot be written" is any exception the backend raises, not just
    ``OSError``. Most remote writes forward their SDK's own error class —
    ``core/s3/write.py`` hands back botocore's ``ClientError``,
    ``core/gridfs/write.py`` pymongo's ``PyMongoError`` — and none of
    those is an ``OSError``, so narrowing the catch would let one
    unreachable operand abort the whole command. ``error_line`` already
    tells the two apart, and this is not swallowing: every caught error is
    named on stderr and the command exits 1. ``Exception`` rather than
    ``BaseException`` keeps cancellation propagating.

    Deliberate divergence: GNU opens every operand up front, so under
    ``exit`` an *open* failure aborts before any data is written. A mount
    has no open/write split — ``write_bytes`` is one call — so the
    operands before the failure are already written. The two agree
    whenever the failure is at write time, which is what a remote backend
    reports.
