    Globs are expanded by the caller, so ``paths`` is a flat list of concrete

    before each file (POSIX/GNU tail with multiple files), separated by a blank
    line between files. The per-file source is produced lazily by ``read``.

    Args:
        paths (list[PathSpec]): Resolved paths; only ``.original`` is read.
        read (Callable[..., Any]): Reader called as ``read(accessor, path,
            index)``; returns bytes, an awaitable of bytes, or an async byte
            iterator.
        accessor (object): Backend accessor passed through to ``read``.
        index (object): Index cache store passed through to ``read``.
        n (int | None): Line count.
        c (int | None): Byte count.
        from_line (int | None): 1-based start line for ``tail -n +N``.
