    plain ``cat reg`` reads the file. Enforcing it on ``stat`` covers
    every family at once, because the read chokepoint

    renders whatever strerror it gets in its own GNU voice. ``readdir``
    is wrapped too, because a listing never stats on its own and a keyed
    store answers a non-directory prefix with an empty list rather than
    an error.

    A missing path is left alone on the read side: its own ENOENT is
    already GNU's answer (``cat dangle/`` is "No such file or
    directory"). On the write side it is not: ``write``, ``append`` and

    anything is there, as open(2) does with O_CREAT, so ``tee missing/``

    instead would strand them behind partials built before any
    invocation exists, which is exactly the wiring that made the rmdir
    guard blind to a mounted child. The stamp happens whether or not
