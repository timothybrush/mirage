    box, dropbox and disk raise IsADirectoryError), a keyed store answers
    ENOENT because a directory there is a set of keys rather than an
    object, and sftp answers with an opaque non-OSError.

    The read family's counterpart of ``with_hidden_guard`` and
    ``with_slash_guard``: reading a directory is never a legitimate call,
    so the refusal belongs to the slot rather than to each builder's
    wiring. It used to belong to the wiring, and 23 of the read builders
    passed a bare ``bound_op(ops.read_stream, ...)`` instead, so a
    directory on a keyed backend reported ENOENT.

    Refined after the failure, never before it, so a read that succeeds
    costs exactly what it did. The refusal is built from the operand's
    own PathSpec, so it carries the virtual path: a raw disk error names
    the host path, which is the mount's own business and must not reach a
    user-facing line.

    The catch is broad and the re-raise is unconditional, which is the
    only way to cover a backend whose directory read is not an OSError at
    all (asyncssh raises SFTPFailure). Nothing is swallowed: the original
    error is re-raised untouched unless a probe positively confirms a
