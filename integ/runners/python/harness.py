    each other and get a lane of their own. That distinction is the
    whole speed of this: gws carries five core targets and s3 three, and

    kinds carry it today. opfs replaces ``globalThis.navigator`` for the
    length of the run and restores the previous descriptor afterwards,
    which no second target may be reading across. The four ``secrets-*``
    targets publish a fetch function into the process-global source
    registry under a fixed name, and the healthy one's closes over a
    per-open counter the cases assert call counts against, so a second
    target on the same kind would silently replace it. Those run first,
    one at a time, before the pool opens; all five are small.

    Positions rather than entries, because the caller holds one output
    slot per position: two ``--target ram`` on one line are two runs, and
